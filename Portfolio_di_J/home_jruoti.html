        <h2>Ciao, I am J! &#128075;</h2>
        <p>I have a degree in Communication Sciences from the University of Milan, and I am currently in the final year of my master's program in â€œTheory and technology of communication" at the University of Milano-Bicocca. I have been playing basketball since I was 8 years old, I love traveling to connect with cultures different from mine, and I am passionate about cinema, comics, and contemporary art. If I were to describe myself in three words, I would say I'm ambitious, self-critical, and empathetic. I have worked in various jobs throughout my life, but never as a UX/UI designer and Front-End Developer. I can't wait to challenge myself in this field as well.</p>
